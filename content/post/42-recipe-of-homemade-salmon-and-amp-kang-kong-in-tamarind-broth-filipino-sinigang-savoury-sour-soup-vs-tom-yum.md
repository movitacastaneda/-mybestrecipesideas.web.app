- "Lower heat when it boils. Taste and add 1 Tbsp fish sauce first...If you dont have this, use salt. Add more tamarind mix if it&#39;s not sour enough or use calamansi juice. Add more fish sauce according to your liking. Cook until the salmon meat changes color (not very long, depends on thickness, 5-6 mins)."
- "Serve hot and spoon soup over rice. Enjoy!"
