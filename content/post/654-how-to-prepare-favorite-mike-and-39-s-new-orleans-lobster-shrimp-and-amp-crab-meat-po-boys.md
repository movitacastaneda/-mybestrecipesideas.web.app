- "I use fresh pre-steamed crab claws. Just crack open and shread meat. Add to large bowl."
- "But, [real] canned crab meat works as well. If opting for canned - drain and carefully sift thru it for any shells."
- "In a pan with a lifted rack and tight fitting lid - add these ingredients to taste. Butter - White Wine - Minced Garlic - Fresh Lemon Juice - Lemon Pepper - Old Bay and bring all to a simmer. Add what you&#39;d like and how you&#39;d like it but don&#39;t allow your fluids to rise above your rack and touch your lobster tails. You want to steam - not boil."

- "Add a piece of butter leaf lettuce - add seafood mixture with a squeeze of lemon - then another piece of lettuce to keep your bread nice and crunchy!"
- "Viola!"
- "Quite possibly the BEST chilled pickles out there! They&#39;re firm and crazy delicious! You&#39;ll only find them in your refrigerated isle of your local chain supermarket."
- "Enjoy this tiny extra rich little taste of NOLA y&#39;all!"
