recipeingredient:
- "2 tbsp vegetable oil"
- " salt"
- " pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Set broiler to 500°F fahrenheit. (Convection ovens cook much faster! Take this into account when placing meat in oven or you may be eating charcoal!)"
- "While the broiler is heating, Take beef (new york strip, ribey, ect.) and rub with Vegetable oil."
- "Salt and pepper to taste! Don&#39;t be scared of adding too much. Worry more on making the coat even."
- "Put a skillet on high on stove top. DO NOT USE NONSTICK. We want it to stick. (I use cast iron - works great) you don&#39;t have to add any oil to the pan while it heats. There is enough on the meat already."
- "Use the skillet to brown the outside of the steak. (The more dark brown the outside the better the flavor) This creates a lot of smoke! Open windows and turn fans on."
- "After the steak is brown and broiler is heated, pop it in the oven on a pan and let it be for 2-3 minuets. IT DOES NOT TAKE LONG FOR A MEDIUM RARE STEAK. If you prefer a more well done steak then let it be in for a few minuets longer, adjusting time accordingly."
