- "Sprinkle seafood lightly with a pinch of ground cumin, ground mustard and ground coriander and a dash of chili powder. Mix well with some olive oil, cover and put back in fridge until ready to use."
- "Combine stock ingredients. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat and allow flavors to blend."
- "Prepare the vegetables."
- "Dice the onion."
- "Dice zucchini."
- "Dice peppers."
- "Dice hot peppers."
- "Jalapeño peppers vary in heat. For hot, look for lines on the pepper."
- "For milder heat, use chile manzano or &#34;apple pepper.&#34; You want a nice bright color all around."
- "Look for bright, shiny and firm, if browning, not fresh."
- "Mince the garlic."
- "In large pot, add 3 tbs extra virgin olive oil, sauté onion and peppers until onion is translucent, then add zucchini and the garlic continue stirring."
- "Place all of the spice blend ingredients into a pot, bring to a boil and remove from heat. Allow to sit 30 minutes and then blend with an electric mixer until smooth."
