recipeinstructions:
- "Two extra large 2 lb chicken breasts pictured below. ● Authors Note: When purchasing raw chicken, choose firm, never frozen, nicely pink colored, fat and bruise free, organic plump breasts for best results every time."
- "Rinse your chicken and cut off anything unsightly. Place in a large bowl and fill with whole ice cubes."
- "Heat up 3 cups water and add everything in the Brine section. Mix well and regularly until all salt and sugars are fully dissolved. Allow brine to cool off before adding it to your chicken and ice mixture."
- "Mix brine with chicken and ice. Add enough ice cold water to fully cover chicken. You&#39;ll want your temperature consistently between 35° and 40°."
- "Seal tightly and place in fridge for 4 hours minimum - 8 hours maximum."
- "While waiting - create your Tzatziki Sauce. Peel, then half your cucumbers lengthwise. Spoon out all seeds and disgard them."
- "Shread and place cucumbers in a strainer with 1 tsp course sea salt. Mix well. Let cucumbers set in the sink for at least an hour - stirring and pressing occasionally. The salt will help to sweat and drain the copious fluids within your cucumbers."
- "Rinse, dry and chop your vegetables into 1.5&#34; cuts. Try to be consistent with chop sizes for grilling continuity. ● Authors Note: When cleaning your mushrooms, gently wipe them down with a damp cloth or paper towel. If you rinse them under water, know they&#39;ll absorb all of that fluid and you&#39;ll end up with a soggy mushroom mess!"
- "After an hour - place your shreaded cucumbers in [preferably] cheese cloth or, several sturdy clean paper towels. Squeeze tightly again and again until all fluids are strained. If not, you&#39;ll have a runny sauce. Add everything in the ● Tatziki Sauce section together, mix well and chill for an hour minimum. It&#39;s best at 2+ hours. Know that as it sits and chills in the fridge, it will take on another delicious flavor all together. Stir your sauce occasionally. Serves 10."
- "Following brine - pull chicken from ice water, drain fluids and place in a dry bowl. Using paper towels, gently dab your chicken strips dry."
- "● Cut chicken breasts into 1.5&#34; pieces. ● Place chicken back in bowl. ● Mix in just enough olive oil to fully coat chicken. Then, season [to taste] with your reserve spices listed above in the ● Brine section. ● Allow chicken pieces to marinate for an hour + in the fridge. I put mine into a Ziplock Bag for space sake but, it&#39;s your choice ● Stir or massage chicken occasionally. ● I&#39;ll marinate my chicken pieces overnight for fullest flavor."
- "Feed your fresh garden vegetables onto your scewers."
- "Lightly spray vegetables with an olive oil spray and season [to taste] with your reserve spices listed in the ● Brine section. Then, spray again to seal on dried seasonings."
- "Thread your marinated chicken on to your metal scewers with a 1&#34; piece of onion in between each chicken cube. This is an important step for #1: flavor and, #2: even grilling. Lightly season chicken again if desired."
- "Clean, spray and fire up your grill."
- "Ready your meat, vegetables and breads. Place your chicken on direct heat and your vegetables on the higher rack away from direct flames. ● Turn chicken regularly. Grill 20 minutes then, turn up the heat and char your chicken and vegetables. Know that brined meat is harder to char so, turn your heat up to at least 500°. Be careful not to burn."
- "Meat on flames - veggies on top rack."
- "Charred chicken and vegetables served in a large bowl. &#34;communal style.&#34;"
- "Extra large Garlic Naan Breads. They come 2 per pack. You&#39;ll need 5 packages. One per person should be enough to fill them up. Especially with a garden, or wedge side salad."
- "Lightly spray your bread of choice on one side with spray Pam. To taste - lightly sprinkle on Cumin, Granulated Garlic and Onion Powder, Italian Seasoning and White Pepper. Then, spray again to seal in those delicious spices. Place on hot grill until bread is slightly charred. Charred, not burnt."
- "Serve chicken and veggies hot on warmed, seasoned and charred Naan Bread. No garnishes are needed other than maybe some fresh Cilantro and of course, your creamy chilled Tzatziki Sauce. Oh, and you don&#39;t want to forget the ice cold beer! Enjoy!"
- "It&#39;s so cool to get your kids to WANT to eat their veggies! Here&#39;s proof positive. My students wake at midnight only to reheat their Vegetarian Style Kebabs wrapped in warmed tortillas with their chilled Tzatziki Sauce! With that, GO TEAM MIKE!"
