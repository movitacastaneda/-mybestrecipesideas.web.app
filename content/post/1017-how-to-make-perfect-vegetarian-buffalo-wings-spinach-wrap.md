This may be a stupid question, but can I just use regular eggs instead of the egg replacer? Haha, I&#39;m a vegetarian (not a full vegan) so I still can eat eggs and just thought it. Spicy seitan Buffalo &#34;wings&#34; are a vegetarian substitute for popular pub Buffalo wings and use seitan instead of chicken for a vegan recipe that is lower in fat and Jolinda Hackett has written five books about plant-based cooking and has developed hundreds of vegan and vegetarian recipes. These vegetarian buffalo wings use seitan as the base,for a great &#34;meaty&#34; texture. Fry all wings in this way.
