Serve it with rice for hearty and flavor-packed vegan meal! Some versions of traditional gumbo do have andouille sausage, but sausage is a bit tougher to replicate than meatballs, so I. Some gumbos do contain sausage, shrimp and chicken, but there are humbler ones that are made with only salt pork, onions and greens. Finally, there is the filé powder camp.
