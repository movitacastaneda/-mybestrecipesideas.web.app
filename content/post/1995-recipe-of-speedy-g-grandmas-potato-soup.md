recipeinstructions:
- "Here we go. Read the WHOLE recipe and gather your ingredients."
- "Peel and cut potatoes into 1/2” cubes"
- "Put in big pot and just cover with water. Cook until partially tender."
- "While potatoes are cooking Chop onions and ham steak. And sauté in separate pan until onions are translucent. Set aside."
- "When potatoes are semi-done add milk. You add 1/2 as much milk as there is water. It loooooooks like a lot. And it is."
- "Add salt and pepper. Lots. Really. You will probably need to add more later too."
- "Add cooked onions and ham. Bring to low boil."
- "While waiting for it to boil make rivlets aka dumplings. The soup is not the same without them so don’t skip this step."
- "Make rivlets by whisking 2 eggs together and then adding flour. So start with 100 grams and then keeping adding flour until the mixture comes together. It’s not too wet or too dry. I know those are awful directions but that’s what we do. As a rule it’s 100 grams of flour per egg but use your best judgement. I don’t really think you can screw them up."
- "Once the soup is boiling add rivlets by using the two teaspoon method. Put some dough on a teaspoon and slide it off into the soup with the other teaspoon. Not too big. They should be about the size of a big marble."
- "Cook for about ten minutes until the rivlets are cooked through. The soup should start getting thicker now because the rivlets start absorbing the broth."
- "Taste and add salt and pepper if needed. It should have a bit of peppery flavor."
- "If you want the soup thicker then thicken with a flour slurry."
- "We add cheese and scallions on the top of the bowl when eating."
- "Good luck and tell me how it goes. Remember be happy while your cooking and it’ll make your food taste better."
