recipeingredient:
- "10 slices aburaage thin fried tofu"
- "500 ml dashi stock about 2 cups"
- "5 Tbsp brown sugar crystals"
- "5 Tbsp soy sauce"
- "3 Tbsp mirin"
- " For the sushi rice"
- "800 grams or 1 34 lb hot cooked white rice about 40 g per pouch"
- "100 ml rice vinegar plus a 3 x 3 cm piece of kombu seaweed"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "3 Tbsp leftover liquid from cooking the aburaage"
- "4 Tbsp white sesame seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the aburaage and plenty of water in a pot, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 20 minutes to drain the excess oil from the aburaage very well. If you don&#39;t drain the excess oil from the aburaage properly, it won&#39;t soak up all the flavors and be a little bland."
- "Drain in a colander. When it cools a little, fold into half, and press down with your palm to drain the excess water really well."
- "Put the dashi stock, brown sugar crystals, soy sauce, mirin and aburaage into a large pot. Cover with a small drop lid that sits right on top of the aburaage, and simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes until the sauce reduces to 1/3 its original volume."
- "After simmering, let it cool a little. Transfer to an airtight container, and leave overnight or more. After sitting overnight, cut in half, and open up the aburaage carefully. Don&#39;t squeeze out the liquid."
- "Make the sushi vinegar. Add the salt to the rice vinegar, then add the kombu and let soak for at least 30 minutes to bring out the kombu&#39;s flavor. The aburaage is sweet, so you don&#39;t need to add sugar to the sushi rice."
- "Transfer the freshly cooked rice into a handai (circular wooden vat-like container for rice) or large bowl, add the sushi vinegar, white sesame, and the sauce from cooking the aburaage over the rice. Fold in gently with a spatula while fanning the rice."
- "Let the sushi rice cool down until just warm to the touch. Make 20 rice balls, and stuff in the aburaage pouches carefully. It&#39;s quicker and easier if you make rice balls first before stuffing them in the aburaage."
- "Don&#39;t stuff too much sushi rice into the aburaage. Gently stuff the rice, and leave the bottom of the pouch (the part I&#39;m pointing to in the photo) without any rice."
- "Brush the sauce left over from cooking the aburaage on the inari sushi for glazing. Lightly cover with plastic wrap, and let sit for at least 2 hours so flavors settle in. It tastes better after all the flavors have melded than when freshly made!"
- "Garnish with pickled ginger and they are all done! It&#39;s best to eat after 4-5 hours!"
- "Here&#39;s what the cross section looks like after 5 hours. It&#39;s difficult to see in this photo, but the flavors from the aburaage soaked into the sushi rice and made it more delicious."
