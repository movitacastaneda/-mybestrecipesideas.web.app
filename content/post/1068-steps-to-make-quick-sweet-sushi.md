Ok, this is not exactly sushi, but it is made using the same composition (different ingredients), shape (bite sized pieces) and technique (rolling). But this &#39;sweet sushi&#39; rice krispie treats, out of all the delicious foods Loralee had on the table, was the one I was snacking on throughout the afternoon. The &#39;rice&#39; part of the sushi is actually rice - puffed. I have seen some sweet sushi around the web and the majority of them used candies as toppings.
