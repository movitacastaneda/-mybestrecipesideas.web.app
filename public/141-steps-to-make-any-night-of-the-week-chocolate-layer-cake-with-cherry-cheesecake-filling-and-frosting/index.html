<p>This chocolate layer cake turns out so fluffy and nice. Good news; you can make this Chocolate Layer Cake with Creme in advance! I baked and assembled it on Friday and served it Sunday afternoon and it was still perfect; kept its fluffiness and the frosting and raspberries. It consists of simple cake layers filled with cheesecake filling and decorated with fresh fruit bouquet. It is dedicated to my grandma, Emma.</p>
