Hey everyone, I hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, we’re going to make a distinctive dish, chicken cordon bleu / instant pot. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I’m gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.
With this Instant Pot version, it comes out moist and flavorful every single time. By creating a casserole you are still incorporating all the traditional flavors of chicken cordon blue, but you are taking out the time and hassle of rolling it up in layers and then.">
