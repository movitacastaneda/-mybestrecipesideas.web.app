<p>Hello everybody, I hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, we&rsquo;re going to make a distinctive dish, healthy chicken stir fry. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>

Healthy chicken stir fry is something which I have loved my whole life. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>This healthy chicken stir fry recipe is a take-off of history's popular Asian chicken stir fry. When it comes to a stir fry, I'm picky. I like my veggies crisp and thick not overly salty sauce covering each piece of chicken.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook healthy chicken stir fry using 19 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-healthy-chicken-stir-fry">The ingredients needed to make Healthy chicken stir fry:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 4 boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
<li>Take 1/2 head cabbage cut into bite sized pieces</li>
<li>Make ready 1 onion quartered and julienned</li>
<li>Make ready 3 cup broccoli, steamed</li>
<li>Prepare 2 clove garlic thinly sliced</li>
<li>Get 1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
<li>Prepare 1 about  1/8 teaspoon ginger</li>
<li>Take 1 1/2 tsp 5 spice</li>
<li>Get 1 olive oil, extra virgin</li>
<li>Take 6 sliced button mushrooms (fresh)</li>
<li>Prepare  sauce (I know a cranberry based sauce sounds kind of odd but trust me it's really good and goes well with the other ingredients</li>
<li>Take 1/2 cup dried cranberries</li>
<li>Get 1/2 tbsp garlic powder</li>
<li>Get 1 dash ginger</li>
<li>Take 1 dash black pepper</li>
<li>Take 1 small dash cinnamon</li>
<li>Get 1 dash 5 spice</li>
<li>Prepare 1 pinch red pepper flake</li>
<li>Prepare 1 about 1 1/2 cup water&hellip;or as needed</li>
</ol>
<p>Put the brown rice on to boil while you prep the remaining ingredients and you can have this meal on the table in about half an hour. Heat the oil in a wok over a high heat. Add the chicken and stir-fry for a couple of minutes. When the mushrooms start to soften, add broccoli florets and stir-fry until the broccoli is tender.</p>
