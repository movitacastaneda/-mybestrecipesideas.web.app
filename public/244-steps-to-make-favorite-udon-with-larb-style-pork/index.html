<p>Hello everybody, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, udon with larb-style pork. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Udon with larb-style pork is one of the most well liked of current trending meals in the world. It is appreciated by millions daily. It is simple, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes delicious. Udon with larb-style pork is something that I have loved my whole life. They are nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>Pork - I used chops, cut into strips. Mushrooms - I used cremini, chopped. Green Onion - Chopped, for garnish.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have udon with larb-style pork using 11 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-udon-with-larb-style-pork">The ingredients needed to make Udon with larb-style pork:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready 1 1/4 lbs lean ground pork</li>
<li>Get 1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
<li>Get 3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>Take 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar</li>
<li>Prepare 4 tbsp fish sauce</li>
<li>Make ready 4 tbsp packed brown sugar</li>
<li>Make ready 1 Thai chilli, finely sliced (optional)</li>
<li>Get 2-7 oz. packages precooked udon noodles</li>
<li>Make ready 2 large stalks of kale, leaves stripped and chopped</li>
<li>Prepare 1 medium carrot, finely grated</li>
<li>Get 2 stalks celery, finely chopped</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also larb dishes that are made with fish or even mushrooms. Larb, or laap as it's known in Laos, Thailand's answer to san choy bau, minus the lettuce cups. Complementing the spicy, aromatic and flavour-packed meat, larb traditionally comes with a side of cabbage, green beans and cucumber. The fresh vegetables are a much-needed cooling aid for when.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-udon-with-larb-style-pork">Steps to make Udon with larb-style pork:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Add a splash of veg oil to a large pan on medium-high heat. Crumble the pork into the pan and then don't touch it for 5 minutes. Seriously, you want to leave it alone so the meat can caramelize and start forming a crust. When the 5 minutes are up, use a wooden spoon to break the meat up further.</li>
<li>After an additional 5 minutes the pork should be pretty much cooked. Add the onion and garlic to the pan and turn down the heat to medium. Give the meat a stir every so often as you prep the sauce and noodles.</li>
<li>In a bowl, whisk together.the vinegar, fish sauce, sugar and chilli. Fill a medium pot with water and put it on high heat. When it comes to a boil, turn off the heat and drop in the udon.</li>
<li>Once the udon noodles break apart (about 2 minutes) drain and add them to the pan of meat along with the kale. Let cook 1 minute, just until the kale softens a bit. Stir in the carrot and celery.</li>
<li>Pour the sauce into the pan and toss everything together. It'll seem overly wet at first, but the noodles will drink up most of the sauce, which will also thicken into almost a glaze. Serve hot.</li>
</ol>
