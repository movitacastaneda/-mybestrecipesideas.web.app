<p>This is an easy go-to dinner recipe that you can make on busy weekdays. Crisp chicken skin, roasted vegetables, all in one-pot? While a simple roast chicken is swell, and fall vegetables are pretty much made for roasting, wouldn't it be nice if there were a recipe that delivered a roast chicken with supremely crisp, crackling skin and juicy meat along with tender. For the vegetables: While chicken is roasting, put garlic, potatoes, peppers, squash, celery hearts, leeks, and onions into a large bowl. Add the remaining prepared oil, season to taste with salt and pepper, and mix well.</p>
