<li>Melt butter in microwave</li>
<li>In large bowl, combine bean sprouts, mushrooms, celery, onions, eggs, garlic, salt, and butter. Hand mix.</li>
<li>Pre-heat fry pan to medium heat (I use a small fry pan)</li>
<li>Before making each pattie, hand mix bean sprout mixture so that liquid on bottom is spooned over the top. Then spoon mixture to form 5-6 inch pattie.</li>
<li>Fry pattie(s) 3 minutes on each side. (patties should be golden brown) I set my iPhone timer.</li>
<li>Cook white rice. Use 2 times the water to the amount of rice. Bring water to boil before adding rice. Reduce heat to low heat, cover pot, and cook rice for 15 minutes. Turn off heat and keep rice covered for 15 more minutes.</li>
<li>Serve rice and 1-2 patties per person. Cover rice and patties with gravy, then serve. Can be served with soy and/or duck sauce as a condiment.</li>
