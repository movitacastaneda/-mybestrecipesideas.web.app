<h5 id="steps-to-make-marbled-pumpkin-cheesecake">Steps to make Marbled Pumpkin Cheesecake:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 300°F. Lightly grease a 9&quot; springform pan with non-stick cooking spray. Then, wrap the bottom and sides of the pan with aluminum foil (heavy duty if you've got it), that way it will be completely water tight for the water bath it will bake in.</li>
<li>Start by making the crust. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter and sugar until they are fully blended and all the crumbs are moistened. Press the crumbs tightly into the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of a prepared pan. I use the bottom of a flat measuring cup to help press the crumbs down tightly. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and set side. Once you take out the crust, increase the oven temperature to 325°F.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, using a hand mixer, blend together the cream cheese, granulated sugar and vanilla extract until just combined. Then add in the eggs, 1 at a time, blending until just combined after each egg. Remove 1 cup of that mix and set it aside in a separate bowl.</li>
<li>Next, add to the remaining cheesecake mix the pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves and allspice. Blend together until just combined&hellip;it is important not to overmix!</li>
<li>Pour the pumpkin cheesecake mix on top of the crust. Then, drop spoonfuls of the regular cheesecake around the top of the pumpkin cheesecake.</li>
<li>Next, take either a butter knife or a skewer and swirl the pumpkin and regular cheesecake together, just until you have a nice marbled pattern.</li>
<li>Place the springform pan into the center of a larger baking tray with deep sides. Fill the baking tray with 1-2 inches of warm water. Baking the cheesecake in a water bath will help to prevent cracks in the finished cheesecake.</li>
<li>Carefully place the baking tray, with the springform pan still in the center, into the oven and bake for about 45 minutes. It is done when the outer edges are firm and very slightly puffy, but the middle should still look moist and a bit wiggly (the center will firm up as the cheesecake cools). Avoid opening the oven door&hellip;If you need to check on it, only open the oven door a tiny crack!</li>
<li>After the 45 minute mark, turn off the oven and open the oven door a crack, but leave the cheesecake in the oven for another hour. After the hour, take it out, remove the pan from the water bath and run a knife along the inner edge of the pan.</li>
<li>Allow the cheesecake to cool slowly, on a wire rack, at room temperature. Place a baking tray or a large upside-down plate over the cheesecake as it cools. I do this to avoid a dramatic change in temperature, which can lead to cracking. I still check it every 25 minutes or so to make sure there's no condensation forming on the plate. After about another hour or so (once it's pretty much reached room temperature), it's ready for the fridge.</li>
<li>Cover the top of the pan with plastic wrap and then place the pan into the fridge and chill for at least 6 hours. I like to prepare this the day before and allow it to chill in the fridge overnight.</li>
<li>Once it has chilled in the fridge for the appropriate amount of time and you are ready to serve it, remove the foil from the outside of the pan and run a knife one more time around the inner edge of the pan. Release the clamp on the side of the pan, then, slowly and gently, remove the side of the pan from the bottom.</li>
<li>Use a warm, sharp knife to slice the pieces&hellip;simply run the knife under hot water and wipe clean between each cut, for neat slices. Refrigerate any leftovers for up to 4-5 days.</li>
