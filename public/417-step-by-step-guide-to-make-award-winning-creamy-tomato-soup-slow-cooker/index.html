<p>Hey everyone, it is John, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, creamy tomato soup - slow cooker. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Creamy Tomato Soup - Slow Cooker is one of the most favored of current trending meals on earth. It&rsquo;s easy, it is fast, it tastes delicious. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions every day. They&rsquo;re fine and they look wonderful. Creamy Tomato Soup - Slow Cooker is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life.</p>
<p>Tomatoes and vegetables simmer all day in the slow cooker, then they're pureed to make this creamy tomato soup that is secretly loaded with veggies! This starts off on the stovetop and is completed in a slow cooker. Other than that this soup is mostly tomato, which I believe the way a true tomato soup is meant to be.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have creamy tomato soup - slow cooker using 12 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-creamy-tomato-soup---slow-cooker">The ingredients needed to make Creamy Tomato Soup - Slow Cooker:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready 1/2 yellow onion, diced</li>
<li>Get 3 large carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
<li>Get 1 stalk celery, diced</li>
<li>Prepare 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>Get 8 large tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
<li>Prepare 3 cups unsalted vegetable broth</li>
<li>Take 2 tbsp. tomato paste</li>
<li>Take 2 tbsp. brown sugar</li>
<li>Take 1 tsp. each dried thyme, dried basil</li>
<li>Take 1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper</li>
<li>Make ready 1/4 cup freshly shredded parmesan cheese</li>
<li>Prepare 1/4 cup cream (or half &amp; half)</li>
</ol>
<p>It cooks in the crockpot 😀 I looooove my crockpot on cold days. In slow cooker, mix tomatoes, broth, green onion whites, garlic, sugar, salt, pepper and pepper flakes. Here's a Slow Cooker easy creamy tomato soup recipe that's perfect for dinner, and only needs a few ingredients! Smooth tomato soup packed with flavor and great for chilly days or year round really.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-creamy-tomato-soup---slow-cooker">Instructions to make Creamy Tomato Soup - Slow Cooker:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Grease the slow cooker and place all of the ingredients inside EXCEPT for the parmesan cheese and the cream. Place the lid on and cook either on low heat for 6-7 hours or high heat for 3-4 hours.</li>
<li>After cook time is up, puree the soup using either an immersion blender or a classic blender. If using a classic blender, blend it up in batches and leave room for the steam to escape while blending.</li>
<li>Once the soup is pureed and smooth, place it back in the slow cooker and stir in the parmesan cheese and the cream. Taste and season with any additional seasonings you think it needs. At this point, I usually add more salt and pepper, more basil and some paprika.</li>
<li>Place the lid back on with the heat at low for 25-30 more minutes, until the soup is heated through. Then serve immediately.</li>
<li>Refrigerate any leftover soup. To reheat it, just place the desired amount in a saucepan over med-high heat and simmer for 5 or so minutes, until heated through. If I have a good amount of soup leftover, then sometimes I'll use the leftover soup as a pasta sauce for an easy dinner option.</li>
</ol>
<p>Served with a grilled cheese it's sure to be your kids favorite meal too. It cooks in the slow cooker! I looooove my slow cooker on cold days…which, this winter has been full of them. Hope you enjoy this recipe as well! Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, garlic, onion, basil, salt, pepper, heavy cream and vegetable or chicken broth to your crockpot.</p>
