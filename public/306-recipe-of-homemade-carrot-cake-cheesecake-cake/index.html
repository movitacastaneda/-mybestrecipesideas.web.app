<p>Every time Easter rolls around, I think… man, I should make a carrot cake cheesecake cake, but then I never do it. Perfectly-spiced, incredibly moist carrot cake sandwiched around a rich layer of vanilla cheesecake and then frosted with a whipped cream cheese icing. I first published this cheesecake/carrot cake recipe a few years ago, but I re-share it every year around Easter (because, just look at it!). This carrot cake cheesecake is supposedly a knock off of the Cheesecake Factory version. I don't know if that's true but I do know that it's really good.</p>
<p>So that is going to wrap it up for this special food carrot cake cheesecake cake recipe. Thanks so much for reading. I&rsquo;m sure that you can make this at home. There&rsquo;s gonna be more interesting food at home recipes coming up. Remember to bookmark this page in your browser, and share it to your family, colleague and friends. Thanks again for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
