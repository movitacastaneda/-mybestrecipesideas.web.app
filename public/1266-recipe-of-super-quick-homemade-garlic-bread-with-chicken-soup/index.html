Hey everyone, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, we’re going to make a distinctive dish, garlic bread with chicken soup. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.
This very garlicky soup is based on some I had while in Madeira - acorda alentejana, which is a famous soup from the Alentejo region of Portugal.">
