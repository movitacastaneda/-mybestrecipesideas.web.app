Hello everybody, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I’m gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, butterscotch pudding cookies. One of my favorites. This time, I’m gonna make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.
When I saw these cookies from the cookie queen herself a month ago, I knew I had to make them. I love butterscotch anything but I was even more intrigued with the pudding in the cookies.">
