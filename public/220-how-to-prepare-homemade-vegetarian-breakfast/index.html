<h5 id="instructions-to-make-vegetarian-breakfast">Instructions to make Vegetarian Breakfast:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Slowly heat up a cast iron pan to medium low. In the meantime, mix eggs in a bowl and set side. Dice veggies to your liking. Small potato cubes (&lt; 1/2&quot;) are easiest to brown on a pan and what I prefer.</li>
<li>Add oil to heated cast iron and cook eggs to your liking. I like medium low for a cast iron for scrambled eggs because it doesn't burn the eggs and it's easier to get fluffy scrambled eggs. I learned from a friend who is a chef at a breakfast restaurant that adding a small amount of milk helps you get fluffier scrambled eggs. Season to taste, I love oregano on my eggs. Set eggs aside.</li>
