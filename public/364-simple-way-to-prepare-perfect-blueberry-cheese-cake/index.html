<p>This Lemon Blueberry Cheesecake is thick, creamy and flavored with tangy lemon and blueberries throughout. It sits in a graham cracker crust and is topped with a homemade blueberry sauce. This delicious blueberry cheesecake is topped with a fresh blueberry topping, and made with lighter cream cheese and Greek yogurt.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook blueberry cheese cake :) using 12 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<p>This show-stopping blueberry swirl cheesecake needs to come with a warning label. Cheesecake so creamy, a graham cracker crust so buttery, and blueberry swirls sooo swirly. You will not be able to stop at one sliver. This cake is one of my favorite cake. :) I really like how the blueberry mixed with cream cheese taste.</p>

<p>Whether it's a berry cream cheese torte, a classic NY-style cheesecake with strawberries or blueberry cheesecake bars, I can't resist the natural sweetness of fruit paired with a smooth cheesecake batter. This cheesecake pie is a quicker, easier version of full-blown. Swirl a fresh blueberry puree into the filling and over the finished cheesecake for a double shot of delicious berry flavor. I decided to test out her blueberry cream cheese pancakes recipe because I've cooked a lot of flapjacks in my time and because, well, I really wanted to lick the First things first, Chrissy has you cut the cream cheese into ¼-inch cubes and put it in the freezer while you make the rest of the batter. Sweet summer blueberries, cream cheese and a hint of lemon zest make this Blueberry &amp; Cheese Coffee Cake the perfect summer treat to go with your morning coffee.</p>
